# MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation using YOLOv7

Instance segmentation using yolov7 on custom dataset for MRL images


# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Brain Tumor Segmentation project using YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. The goal of this project is to accurately identify and delineate tumor regions in MRI scans, which can significantly assist medical professionals in diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises a collection of MRI brain scan images, each labeled with corresponding tumor annotations. Due to the sensitivity of medical data and the Dataset should be in the yolov7 format.

# Installation
Clone the repository of yolov7 for segmentation
# Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Preprocessing:
Update the configuration files to set the necessary parameters for training and inference.

Train the YOLOv7 model on the preprocessed dataset.

Evaluate the model on a separate validation set.

Perform inference on new MRI brain scans to segment brain tumors.

# Training

Make sure to update the data.yaml and yolov7.cfg files with the appropriate paths and configurations.

# Evaluation
To check the evaluation test it for test-images
